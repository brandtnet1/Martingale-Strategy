# Grade

Code is almost perfect, with one bug:

current_bet == current_money

This is performing a comparison instead of the assignment you want.

Also, descriptive comments are helpful, but there's no need to include comments that just restate the code in words:

if rand > .5:  # If the random number is greater than .5

Use your comments to describe *non-obvious* aspects of your programs.
